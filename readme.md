Basic Set-up
============
Weekend Challenge #5 Description
This is the LAST weekend challenge!

In this challenge, you will be creating a Pet Application that allows a user to create Pets that are stored in a database. Then, in another view, the user can see the list of pets.

You will need three views:

Home view - Nothing special, just greeting the user, giving them direction on how to use the application,

Add view - This page will allow the user to add a new pet with a form,

Pets view - Meaning that the user can see a list of the entered pets.

You will use the full MEAN stack for this (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node)

Each Pet will need to have the following information: - Name (example, Grilled Cheese) - Animal (example, Cat), - Age (example, 14) - Image Url

Everyone, post info and image URL links to your pets in the #pi room for everyone!

Hard Mode
Look into delete functionality with Mongoose and add a button in the Pets view to delete a pet from the database. This will require research in how to identify the pet that is supposed to be deleted from the database.

Pro Mode
Look into Filtering. In the Pets view, include a button to turn on Alphabetical Sorting of the pets that can be toggled on and off.
